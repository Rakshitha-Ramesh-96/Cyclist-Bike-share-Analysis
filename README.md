# Project 1 : Cyclist-Bike-share-Analysis

### Project is done with Python 

This case study is the **capstone project of Google Data Analytics Professional Certification**.In this case study I am working as the a junior data analyst in the marketing analyst team at Cyclist, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago.

A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, we are trying to understand **how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently**.From the insights our team will design new marketing stratergy of converting the casual riders into anual riders.
